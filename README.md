# AutomateMe
A compilation of python scripts, which will help me in day to days tasks

This repo will have some cool stuffs, boring stuffs or maybe too obvious stuffs as well, but if it's saving me even 2 minutes, then this is quite worthy.....

## automate_apk
This script mainly creates an apk, in `app_name`-v`app_version`.apk manner, where app_name and app_version are basically user inputs.
So, what this does is, it creates an apk and opens the folder containing the apk, with the above mentioned name format, so that I can make coffee in the meantime.
This script is pretty much very basic as of now but, it can be interesting if it can send it to a desired location, instead of opening folder (it's in to do list already)

Sorry, if you read this, forgot to automate this as well...
