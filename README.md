# AutomateMe
A compilation of python scripts, which will help me in day to days tasks

This repo will have some cool stuffs, boring stuffs or maybe too obvious stuffs as well, but if it's saving me even 2 minutes, then this is quite worthy.....

## automate_apk
This script mainly creates an apk, by just taking 3-4 inputs in the starting.
So, what this does is, it creates an apk and opens the folder containing the apk, with the above mentioned name format, so that I can make coffee in the meantime.

## git_logger
This script basically outputs the `oneline` commits. Although, quite simple and not so useful for many but still automates a quite simple task

## insta_poster
This script will simply post a `post` on `instagram` 

Sorry, if you read this, forgot to automate this as well...
